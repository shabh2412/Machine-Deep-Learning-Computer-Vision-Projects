# **üê∂ Multil-class Dog Breed Classification**

*This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub.*

## ***1. Problem***

*Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.*

*When I'm sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.*

## ***2. Data***

*The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.*

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

## ***3. Evaluation***

*The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.*

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation

## ***4. Features***

*Some information about the data:*

*   *We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.*
*   *There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).*
*   *There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).*
*   *There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).*

### ***Get our workspace ready***


*   ***Import TensorFlow 2.x ‚úÖ***
*   ***Import TensorFlow Hub ‚úÖ***
